# resNet-python

My implementation of resnet, offering alternatives to the original structure.
 
Differences:
    
    * Maxpooling default pooling method
    * Activation type changeable
    * Optional Dropout
    * Conv2d bias toggle on /off
    * Optional ensemble predictions stacked from multiple blocks.
